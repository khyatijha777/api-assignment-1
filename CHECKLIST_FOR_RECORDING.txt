BROWSER PREPARATION:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
□ Tab 1: Prefect UI (http://localhost:4200)
□ Tab 2: API Health Check (http://localhost:5000/health)
□ Tab 3: API Details (http://localhost:5000/app/details)
□ Tab 4: Prefect Login (if required) - bookmarked
□ Clear browser history (optional, for clean look)

□ Dashboard image ready in dashboard/ folder

FILES TO CHECK EXIST:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
□ heart.csv (original dataset)
□ heart_processed.csv (will be generated)
□ models/ folder exists
□ reports/ folder exists
□ dashboard/ folder exists
□ logs/ folder exists

TEST RUNS:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
□ Test Prefect server startup: WORKS
□ Test ML pipeline execution: WORKS
□ Test API server startup: WORKS
□ Test all 6 API endpoints: ALL WORK
□ Test Prefect UI access: WORKS
□ Verify models are saved: VERIFIED
□ Verify metrics are saved: VERIFIED

AUDIO/VISUAL CHECK:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
□ Screen resolution set appropriately
□ Microphone volume tested
□ Audio quality checked
□ Video quality checked
□ Screen sharing software tested
□ Mouse cursor visible and smooth
□ Zoom to windows properly set

CONTENT REVIEW:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
□ All services can start successfully
□ No errors in console
□ API responds correctly
□ Prefect UI loads properly
□ Models can be loaded
□ Dashboard can be generated
□ All necessary files exist
□ No broken imports or dependencies
□ System resources adequate (RAM, CPU)

DURING RECORDING - REMEMBER:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
□ Speak clearly and at steady pace
□ Explain what you're clicking/showing

□ Close all terminals
□ Save any notes made during recording
□ Review recorded footage
□ Edit video if needed (remove mistakes)
□ Add annotations if helpful
